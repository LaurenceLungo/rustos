Why canâ€™t you write to CLO or CHI? (restricted-reads)

The BCM2837 documentation states that the CLO and CHI registers are read-only. 
Our code enforces this property. How? What prevents us from writing to CLO or CHI?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLO and CHI here are defined as type ReadVolatile, our implementation of ReadVolatile
makes it impossible to write he underlying pointer, as discussed in (enforcing) question.
