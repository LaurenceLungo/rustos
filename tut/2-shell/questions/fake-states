What would go wrong if a client fabricates states? (fake-states)

Consider what would happen if we let the user choose the initial 
state for a Gpio structure. What could go wrong?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

User will then not be restricted by the state machine, which allows
the user to do unintented transition of states on the GPIO, which 
may lead to unexpected behaviours.
