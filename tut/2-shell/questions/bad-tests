Why does the test.sh script always set -r? (bad-tests)

The test.sh script that we have provided always uses the -r flag; 
it doesn’t test that your utility uses the XMODEM protocol when it is asked 
to. Why might that be? What does the XMODEM protocol expect that sending data 
in the raw doesn’t that makes testing its functionality difficult?

XMODEM protocal expect an additional Xmodem::receive() to receive the output.
