How do you set other GPIO pins? (1-blinky)

In assignment 1-blinky, you enabled GPIO pin 16 as an output 
and then repeatedly set and cleared it by writing to registers 
GPFSEL1, GPSET0, and GPCLR0. Which three registers would you 
write to to do the same for GPIO pin 27? Which physical pin on 
the Raspberry Pi maps to GPIO pin 27?

-----------------------------------------------------------

Accoridng to the BCM2837 ARM Peripherals Manual, GPFSEL2, GPSET0, and GPCLR0
shoudl be used. GPIO 27 maps to pin 13 on the pi.
