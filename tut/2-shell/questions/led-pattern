Which pattern did you choose? (led-pattern)

What pattern did you have your LEDs blink in? If you haven’t yet 
decided, one fun idea is to have them imitate a “loading spinner” 
by arranging the LEDs in a circle and turning them on/off in a 
sequential, circular pattern.

I tried the loading spinner, but I immediately turned the pi off
because staring at the loading circle makes me impatient and 
annoyed haha.
