Why should we never return an &mut T directly? (drop-container)

You’ll notice that every example we’ve provided wraps the mutable reference 
in a container and then implements Drop for that container. What would go 
wrong if we returned an &mut T directly instead?

The reference count would not be tracked, so we cannot use reference count to 
ensure only one mutable reference is returned at a time.
