How are read-only and write-only accesses enforced? (enforcing)

The ReadVolatile and WriteVolatile types make it impossible to 
write and read, respectively, the underlying pointer. How do they 
accomplish this?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

ReadVolatile only has Readable trait implemented, which only has
read function which returns the value the pointer referecnces to
through read_volatile(), but no write function.

WriteVolatile only has Writable trait implemented, which only has
write function which write the value to the pointer address through 
write_volatile(), but no read function.
