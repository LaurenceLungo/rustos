Which tests make use of the Deref implementations? (deref-in-tests)

Read through the tests we have provided in src/tests.rs. Which tests 
would fail to compile if the Deref implementation did not exist? What 
about the DerefMut implementation? Why?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

If Deref not implemented: 

assignment_text_example(), iterator() would fail to compile becasue the .iter() 
method, which is automatically implemented when Deref is implemented, is missing for StackVec.

index_oob(), index_oob_after_truncate(), indexing(), mut_indexing() would fail 
to compile becasue rust cannot immutably dereference stack_vec and index into stack_vec[_].

If DerefMut not implemented: 

mut_indexing() would fail to compile becasue rust cannot mutably dereference stack_vec and 
assign value to stack_vec[_].
