Why does Unique<Volatile> exist? (unique-volatile)

Both Volatile and Unique<Volatile> allow read/write volatile 
accesses to an underlying pointer. According to the documentation, 
what is the difference between these two types?

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Unique<Volatile> indicates that the possessor of this wrapper owns the 
referent while Volatile does not. The referent of Unique<Volatile> pointer
can only be modified wiht a unique path to the Unique reference while 
Unique doesn't have this limit. Unique<Volatile> also implements Sync
if its wrapper type implements Sync, allowing access from multiple threads.
