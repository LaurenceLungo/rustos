You might be thinking that the free space we’ve set apart isn’t enough. 
This is a fair concern. One way to answer the question is to look at the 
file size of kernels from successful operating systems. Would they fit?

Determine how large the kernel binary is for the operating system you’re 
running now. On newer versions of macOS, the binary is /System/Library/Kernels/kernel. 
On older versions of macOS, the binary is /mach_kernel. On Linux, the binary is usually 
located in /boot/ and is named either vmlinuz, vmlinux, or bzImage. How big is your 
kernel’s binary? Would it fit in the 63.5MiB free space we’ve created?

I'm using macOS Catalina and the kernel is 15.3MiB only, so 63.5MiB should be more than
enough for lab2.
