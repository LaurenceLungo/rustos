How much memory is reported by the MEM tag? (atag-mem)

What is the exact start address and size of the available memory reported by the MEM ATAG? 
How close is this to the Raspberry Piâ€™s purported 1GB or RAM?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The start address is 0 and memory size is 994050048 bytes, which equals 0.93GB. Dodgy move!
But yeah it is still close.
